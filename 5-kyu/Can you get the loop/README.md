You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

```javascript
// Use the `getNext' method or 'next' property to get the following node.
node.getNext()
node.next
```

### Note: do NOT mutate the nodes!
